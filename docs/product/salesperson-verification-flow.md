# Salesperson Verification Flow

1. Salesperson requests link to an organization (provides evidence/links).
2. Platform notifies org approvers.
3. Org approver approves/rejects.
4. On approval: salesperson may post under that org; on rejection: no rights, can retry.

Edge cases:
- Multiple orgs per salesperson.
- Org can revoke at any time; active listings remain but future edits blocked unless transferred.
- Unverified mode: can post but with restrictions (moderation queue, limited features).
